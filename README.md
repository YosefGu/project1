Hello everyone!

Before everything!

I'm still working on this project, please don't judge..

For me, the main thing in this project is to practice Node.js and React.js,
And for this reason I rarely deal with CSS or Ani style tools like bootstrap or MUI. at this moment

I've already built a React app with a connection to mongoDB-Atlat, with options to add and delete notes on the main page.
In the future, I would like to add a login and user registration page, so that the information will be accessible by user.

post Scriptum. There is an env file with DB access information, but for security reasons I did not upload it to GIT.
Thank you!
